    Enrollment Restrictions and the Adoption of Conservation Practices

  <p>
    I employed stated-preference technique with farmer survey data to measure the willingness-to-accept for new technology to restore erosion farmland, and used a discrete-choice modelling framework to examine farmer behavioral response to limited incentives. In the policy assessment part, I adopted the Soil \& Water Assessment Tool with the integrated CENTURY carbon model to simulate the impact on the nutrient reductions and mitigation of GHG emissions.

  <p>
    we designed a new randomize control experiment with the aim to assess the economic benefits/costs of conservation practice implementation, as well as assess potential synergistic co-benefits of nutrient reduction practice implementation, such as carbon sequestration, habitat and air quality, and how these co-benefits could drive changes in practice implementation.
